Introduction: 

What is an HTML element?
- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
- <startTag> some content </endtag>
- Attributes provide additional information about elements
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

For example: 
<h1> Hello World> </h1>

Note: 
Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element) called empty elements. 
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
