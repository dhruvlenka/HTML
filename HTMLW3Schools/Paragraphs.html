        Horizontal Rules
        The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most
        often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        - hr stands for horizontal.

        The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        -->
        <hr>

          <h3 style="color: blue;"> What is HTML?</h3>
          <p style="color: chocolate;" >HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
          <br>
            and design webpages. It provides the structure for web content by using
          <br>
            a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings,
          <br> 
            paragraphs, links, images, and more. Each element is enclosed in angle
          <br>
            brackets, with most tags requiring an opening and a closing tag, such
          <br>
            as for a paragraph and to end the paragraph.
