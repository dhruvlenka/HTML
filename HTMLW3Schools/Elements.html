Nested HTML Elements
- HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
- All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
- The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

Note:
HTML is not case sensitive, we can write paragraph as <p> or <P>.

 <!Doctype html>
 <html>
    <head>
        <title> HTML Elements </title>
    </head>

    <body> 
        <!-- Document body -->
        <p> Nested </p>
        <!-- br defines the line break.-->
        <p> This is a <br> paragraph with a line break. </p>
    </body>
 </html>
